911Alert
========

Public Safety Text Alert

Utilizes the Twilio and Socrata API's to grab data from Seattle's Live 911 Call stream.

There is a webpage where userbase can be added to at: http://integrated-alert.appspot.com

The java program will monitor the 911 stream for incidents that are of concern to the public safety.
The program will then text all users that have registered the same zip code as where the incident occured.
